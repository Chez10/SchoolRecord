# SchoolRecord

Colaborators: Kevin Sanchez Criado, Ethan Shim, Abel Year 
Group project based on a university or any school program. It can be used to store the information of students and professors, keeping the records of the institution. The design of the program is very simplistic to make a very intuitive user interaction throughout the program made using Java, which is connected to our database that has multiple tables that were developed with SQL.
